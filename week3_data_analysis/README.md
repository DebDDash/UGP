## Week3

`data-analysis/data_pre.py` - converts h5 files data to csv (not useful as the csv files becomes very large in size and have no useful meaning other than inspecting) \\
`data_exploration.ipynb` - basic preprocessing by loading data into dfs and exploring it \\
`finalModelv1.ipynb` - basic multi-encoder architecture for our project
